Now, we are going to write some code so that any items marked as done are crossed out. Letâ€™s update the contents of `MyApp/models.py` to:

```python
from django.db import models
from .utils import strike

class TodoItem(models.Model):
    text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    done = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def __str__(self):
        if self.done == True:
            return strike(self.text)
        else:
            return self.text
```
Using the app, edit the to-do item and click on the checkbox to mark it as done.

If you go back to your list of to-do items, you should see your item crossed out because it was marked as done.
