# How To Code a To-do List App

### Introduction

What you will build in this tutorial is a to-do list web application. The app will allow the user to: 

- Create a to-do item
- Edit to-do item text
- Mark a to-do item as completed
- Delete a to-do item

We will use something called the Django Web Framework to quick churn-out a working app as quickly as possible.
